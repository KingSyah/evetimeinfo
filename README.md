# 🌌 EVE Time Info — Galactic Time Buddy for Capsuleers

**https://kingsyah.github.io/evetimeinfo/**

⏱️ **EVE Online runs on UTC time**, and if you've ever missed a fleet op, PI cycle, or structure timer because your Earth-bound brain runs on local time — you're not alone, pilot!

**EVE Time Info** is your slick, no-nonsense web tool that tells you:
- 📆 What time it is in **EVE (UTC)**
- 🕖 Your **local time** (auto-detected)
- 🔄 Easy comparison between **EVE time and your own timezone**
- 🛰️ Perfect for scheduling fleet ops, mining fleets, or AFK cloaky camping 😎

---

## 🚀 Why Use This?

Because the *real battle* is sometimes against time zones, not Triglavians.

- ✅ No ads, no login, no corp drama
- ✅ Works on any browser (even on Jita 4-4 undock)
- ✅ Super lightweight, loads faster than a Garmur
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (for when you're doing market stuff on the toilet 🚽)

## 🛠️ How It Works

This site uses:
- Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS (no React bloat here!)
- JavaScript Date objects to keep things auto-updating
- UTC-based clock sync to match EVE Server time

---

## 🧠 Fun Fact

The EVE server has never reset its clock — it's all in **UTC**, all the time. Which makes it one of the few things in New Eden you can actually *rely on*.

## 💡 Ideas for Future Features
- Countdown to daily reset or downtime
- Fleet op planner with time conversion
- Multiple timezone support for corp leaders
- Optional ship spinning background 😏
